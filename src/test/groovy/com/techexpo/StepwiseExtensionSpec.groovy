/**
 * Demonstrates how &#64;Stepwise causes a spec to be run in incremental steps.
 * Change a step's condition from <tt>true</tt> to <tt>false</tt>, and observe
 * how the remaining steps will be skipped automatically on the next run.
 * Also notice that if you run a single step (e.g. from the IDE's context menu),
 * all prior steps will also be run.
 *
 * <p><tt>&#64;Stepwise</tt> is particularly useful for higher-level specs whose
 * methods have logical dependencies.
